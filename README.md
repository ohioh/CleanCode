A Summary of Clean Code Book from Robert C. Martin (Autor) *big thanks for the coding lessons*

Robert C. “Uncle Bob” Martin has been a software professional since 1970 and an international software consultant since 1990. He is founder and president of Object Mentor, Inc., a team of experienced consultants who mentor their clients worldwide in the fields of C++, Java, C#, Ruby, OO, Design Patterns, UML, Agile Methodologies, and eXtreme programming.

Even bad code can function. But if code isn't clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn't have to be that way. Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship. Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code "on the fly" into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer--but only if you work at it. What kind of work will you be doing? You'll be reading code--lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what's right about that code, and what's wrong with it. More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft. Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity.Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code--of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and "smells" gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code. Readers will come away from this book understanding *How to tell the difference between good and bad code *How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code *How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes *How to format code for maximum readability *How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic *How to unit test and practice test-driven developmentThis book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.</br>

## Chapter 1: Clean Code
Every movement of change needs energy. Aspecially to get a clean coder needs the motivation to go to this process. Oncle Bob did right to show us first the benefit of a clean code.Additional we try to answers the question about differenct views to identify clean code and the problem with bad code. 
The summary contains the understanding for different perspectives of aggregations to the code and 

Bad Code
We try to develop our product with rush and just working code. we keep cleanning up the codes for later. But day by day the working bad codes create lots of bugs in future. It could breakdown a company for handling those unclean codes. We all know the law later equal never.

The Total Cost of Owning a Mess
If you continue the development with unclean code, later modification and adding of that code will be hard. The scaleability will be almost zero. So the aggregated bunch of unclean code could cost you whole fortune.

The Grand Redesign in the Sky
When you will realise that the we cannt make any changes on that messy code , you have to redesign the same functionality code with deiffernt experts. And if that experts dont code cleanely then you have to redesign it again and again.
