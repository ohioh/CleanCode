## Refactoring with Header-files and function-file

In this case we use classes and files structure to refactor the code to optimize readability.
In your Maincode, you have to impliment the header file to have access to the class and destructured functionality.
The header file  lets call it like the sensor in this example. Important is the syntax to name the file like the Class.
The compiler needs this information to get the right enrty point to compose the code.


```
#ifndef DHT22_H  //necessary for tghe compiler to safe work time
#define DHT22_H

#include <Arduino.h>

class DHT22()
{
  private:
  
  public:
  DHT22(); //default constructor
  
  
};
#endif
